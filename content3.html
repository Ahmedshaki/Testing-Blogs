                    Seasoned Indian shuttler H S Prannoy has revealed that he has been battling a chronic gastrointestinal disorder for the past four months which has not just hampered him physically but also taken a mental toll as he had fought these health issues not so long ago.

                    Prannoy was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease during the 2018 World Championships, a chronic disorder that causes symptoms like heartburn, abdominal and chest pain, and inflammation of vocal chords.

                    Prannoy's training and performance were affected by it in 2019-2020 but he had recovered from it and the after-effects of COVID-19 to slowly and steadily regain his place in the top echelons of men's singles. But he revealed that the he hasn't been all that well for past four months once again.

                    "A health issue has been bothering me for the last four months. That has kind of taken a toll in the last four months, mentally and physically for me, to be in the right physical state which I think I was in the last two years," World No.9 Prannoy told PTI during a free-wheeling interview.

                    "But I think it's all part and parcel of this whole career that there can be a lot of times that we are feeling good. If you're not consistent in what you're doing, then you can take a hit and go back to where you were before.

                <p>
                    "He knows we expect a lot from him. He wasn't at his best at the beginning of the season," he explained.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    "On the tour, he didn't have the best attitude that he should have, but now he's training better and getting his chances. He's deserving of his chances."

                <br>
                <p>
                    "It is the same gut issue which had cropped up in 2019. We will get better in the coming months. So yeah, I just need to be a bit more patient," he said.
