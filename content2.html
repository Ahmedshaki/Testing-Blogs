                    When Cristiano Ronaldo was banished for good from Manchester United in November 2022, it was heralded as a victory for Erik ten Hag's new approach.

                    went rogue with his tell-all interview with Piers Morgan and while he made his own bed by criticising the Glazers, few believed

                    would be backed over a club legend. Yet just a few months into his tenure, United stood firm and the Dutchman came out looking stronger than ever.

                    But while United's head coach was savouring a victory, an unseen battle was beginning to rear its head.

                    was coming to the fore in his idol's absence which left Ten Hag with difficult questions to answer.

                    In his first pre-season tour, the manager picked Garnacho to join the first team but he failed to make any appearances

                    . This scuppered any hope for the winger out in Asia much to fans' disappointment.

                    It is true what people say, first impressions count and while

                    insisted they had worked past any attitude worries, their actions in the media showed otherwise. In October and November of that year, Garnacho was beginning to make strides but soon-to-be captain Bruno Fernandes called him out after a good performance.

                    "He knows we expect a lot from him. He wasn't at his best at the beginning of the season," he explained.

                <p>
                    "On the tour, he didn't have the best attitude that he should have, but now he's training better and getting his chances. He's deserving of his chances."

                    after Garnacho's two assists against Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup: "He still has things to learn but quite obviously we are happy with his development and he can contribute to the team. It depends on his approach, his attitude.
