                <h4>Nobody means to drop catches but when a team drops those offered by Virat Kohli, not once but twice, it often fears the worst. Risk-free accumulation is the bedrock of Kohli’s batting, even in T20 cricket, and if he gets lives, it makes him even more determined to dig in.Punjab Kings had already played into Kohli’s hands, in some ways, by omitting their pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada and their miserly left-arm finger spinner Harpreet Brar, the style of bowling that has often kept Kohli in check in T20s.</h4>

                <h4>When Cristiano Ronaldo was banished for good from Manchester United in November 2022, it was heralded as a victory for Erik ten Hag's new approach.Ronaldo went rogue with his tell-all interview with Piers Morgan and while he made his own bed by criticising the Glazers, few believed Ten Hag would be backed over a club legend. Yet just a few months into his tenure, United stood firm and the Dutchman came out looking stronger than ever.</h4>
