                    Nobody means to drop catches but when a team drops those offered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli"> Virat Kohli</a>, not once but twice, it often fears the worst. Risk-free accumulation is the bedrock of Kohli’s batting, even in T20 cricket, and if he gets lives, it makes him even more determined to dig in.
    
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Kings">Punjab Kings </a> had already played into Kohli’s hands, in some ways, by omitting their pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada and their miserly left-arm finger spinner Harpreet Brar, the style of bowling that has often kept Kohli in check in T20s. That skipper Sam Curran chose to field first meant Punjab Kings were devoid of express pace at the start and economy in the middle. The foundation for the 60-run defeat that knocked them out of play-off contention was laid with the choices made before a ball was bowled.

                    Despite that, IPL debutant Vidwath Kaverappa should have got the prize wicket, if only Ashutosh Sharma – running back from cover – and Rilee Rossouw – diving at short cover – had held on to admittedly tough chances. Those were not the only catches dropped by the sloppy Punjab Kings, Harshal Patel dropping a dolly at deep backward square to reprieve Rajat Patidar, which kickstarted the onslaught by Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

                    Other than the dropped catches, Kohli lived a charmed life at the start of his innings, with many of his errant shots landing in vacant territory or in front of fielders. But one knew that it was a passing phase and if he stayed in the middle for any length of time, the fielding side would have to play. The lack of express pace in the bowling attack meant he could step down the track and hit over the top with freedom, one such shot going all the way even though one hand came off the bat.

                    RCB were 119/3 at the halfway mark, when a short interruption for rain and hail made it easier for batting, with the slightly two-paced nature of the wicket rectified. Hitting against spin has been mentioned as one of the recent issues in Kohli’s batting but on Thursday, he slog-swept Rahul Chahar and Liam Livingstone into the stands with impunity.

                    At the innings break, Kohli mentioned that he made it a point to maintain a high strike rate, which was very nearly 200 for the whole innings.
